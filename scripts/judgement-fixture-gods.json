As a God, he maintains his warrior instincts and his inquisitive nature, but his impulse-control and focus is lacking. Bruelin now things of himself as being Dragon Kin - the stuff of Dwarf nightmares. His physical shape has grown to titanic proportions, and he walks the plane of Mideon looking for anything that might provide entertainment. He is insatiably curious but, due to his size, this often translates into him being incredibly destructive. Champions of Bruelin are often brash warriors, valuing their might over their minds.","divineGifts":{"effigy_power":{"avatar_bonus":"Zhonyja permanently gains Unerring Accuracy.

By communing with the spirits of nature, she had been shown the horror of Mideon. As a God, Grul has become a part of the very landscape of Mideon, and it a part of her. Able to transform her shape at will, she often appears not as a humanoid but as a verdant forest glade, her voice a whisper on the wind. She only appears to those who pass the challenges that she offers and prefers champions who have a good heart, but she also embraces those who find themselves cast out and alone.","divineGifts":{"effigy_power":{"avatar_bonus":"For the remainder of the game, friendly models that begin their activation within 2 hexes of Gendris gain Pathfinder for that activation.
